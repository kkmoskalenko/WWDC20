# WWDC 2020
This repository contains a Swift playground submitted for the [WWDC 2020 Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/).

The playground demonstrates a word game built entirely in SwiftUI. It provides you a swipeable wheel of letters that can be used to spell words. Besides, you're given an empty crossword pattern to be filled with the found words.

The game supports both light and dark appearances and automatically adjusts to any screen size. It uses several different types of transitions and animations. The game levels can be stored and transmitted in the JSON format.
